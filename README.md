# StereoGlue

More examples and fitting problems are coming soon!

## Installation

Clone the repository and its submodules:
```
git clone https://github.com/danini/stereoglue.git
```

Make sure that you have the necessary libraries installed:
```
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev libopencv-contrib-dev libarpack++2-dev libarpack2-dev libsuperlu-dev libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev pybind11
```

To run affine feature detection and matching with the built-in tools, install:
```
pip install kornia
pip install kornia-moons

git clone https://github.com/cvg/LightGlue.git && cd LightGlue
python -m pip install -e .
```

Install StereoGlue by running
```
pip install .
```

## Requirements

- Eigen 3.0 or higher
- CMake 2.8.12 or higher
- OpenCV 3.0 or higher
- A modern compiler with C++17 support

# Evaluation

## Jupyter Notebook examples

The example for essential matrix fitting with gravity-based solver is available at: [notebook](examples/example_essential_matrix_fitting_gravity.ipynb).

The example for fundamental matrix fitting with monodepth-based solver is available at: [notebook](examples/example_fundamental_matrix_fitting.ipynb).

The weights for the affine correspondence estimation can be downloaded from [link](https://github.com/bluedream1121/self-sca-ori/tree/main/trained_models). 

The model for feature orientation and scale estimation can be downloaded from [link](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/BZSC37iIS1jF4A6).
